For the U.S. House of Representatives, runoff elections were held in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Texas.)  For Louisiana, the December election vote totals have been included with the general election totals.",,,,,,

"*  The votes for both full and unexpired terms are included in the totals.  This applies to Hawaii (Senate), Oklahoma (Senate), South Carolina (Senate), New Jersey (NJ/01), North Carolina (NC/12), and Virginia (VA/07).",,,,,,
,,,,,,
The following three situations account for blank spaces in the charts and should be considered when making comparisons or drawing conclusions about the vote totals.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"*  In some states, i.e., Connecticut, Utah and Virginia, political parties may nominate general election candidates by party convention, rather than by primary election.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"*  In some states, there were unopposed candidates whose names did not appear on a ballot and therefore received no votes.",,,,,,
